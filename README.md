# operating-systems-3

This is the repository for the course Operating Systems 3 that I take at UGent.

The assignments are in Dutch but the code will be in English.

## Easy access

A batch file can be created to ease the access to the directory in Windows. First create the batch file with the name ```gotoOS3.bat```. Next, click with the right mouse button on the file and choose Edit. Copy paste the following code into the file.

```
@ECHO OFF
CD /D "<absolute path to the directory>"
CMD
```

Now you can just double click the batch file and you're located in the directory.
